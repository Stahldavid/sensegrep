# Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally short-horizon and focused on adoption + reliability.

## Now (Month 1): Adoption and DX

- Publish integration recipes for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and CI.
- Publish reproducible case studies focused on practical search outcomes.
- Improve repository onboarding with README media and faster time-to-value.
- Standardize issue labels for contributor routing (`good first issue`, `help wanted`, etc.).

## Next (Month 2): Benchmark Methodology

- Publish reproducible benchmark design vs `ripgrep` and `ast-grep`.
- Add fixed datasets + query sets with documented constraints.
- Report quality and latency metrics with transparent methodology.
- Automate benchmark reports in CI as non-blocking artifacts.

## Later (Month 3): Ecosystem Expansion

- Expand language coverage and language-specific variants.
- Improve editor and MCP ergonomics based on recipe feedback.
- Add more guided migration paths from text-first workflows to semantic workflows.
